# Overgeared – Mod Compatibility Datapack

This datapack adds **recipe compatibility** for **[Overgeared](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/overgeared)**, integrating items and materials from other mods into Overgeared’s progression and crafting systems in a consistent, intuitive way.

The idea is to make Overgeared **play nicely with a broader mod ecosystem**, without breaking immersion or player expectations.
